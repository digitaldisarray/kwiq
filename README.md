# NOTICE
I kinda picked up intrest in this again.

# kwiq
:rocket: A fast, lightweight, and terminal based menu framework.

Todo:
 - Fancy colors
 - Fancy graphics
 - Window system
 - Mouse support?
 - More languages

## Who the hell would use this?
This is not meant to be with any actual release version of any software. Kwiq is designed for devs to take features that they have made for something, and quickly paste them together in an organized manner.
